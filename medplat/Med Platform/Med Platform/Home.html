              <h1>Our Aim</h1>
              <p id="aim">Since its establishment in 2004, Hercules Medical Diagnostic and Laboratory Group has been committed to serving the public through comprehensive medical diagnostic services of superior standard and quality. Throughout these years, we contributed to the community by providing professional and reliable health check services.
We realize that the escalating healthcare costs have created a heavy burden on the Government and the public. The expenditure of public health services constituted 14.4% of recurrent public expenditure in 2004-05. Solo-practice clinics or individual specialists, however, have been finding it difficult to maintain the balance between price and quality of service. We believe that delivering comprehensive and high quality medical diagnostic services in a reasonable price range through group practice is a path to achieve business excellence.</p>
